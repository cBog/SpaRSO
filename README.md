# SpaRSO

This project was implemented for a masters project. 

It contains an extremely hacky and horible implementation of [Random Search Optimisation (RSO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05955.pdf) and a sparse extension to it called Sparse RSO (SpaRSO) and a number of utilities for recording experiments.

Please feel free to reach out if you're interested.
